# InceptMan

InceptMan is a deep learning model designed for mandible reconstruction, as proposed in our paper, "[InceptMan: An InceptionNeXt-Based Architecture for End-to-End Mandible Reconstruction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048542)" The input is a binary volumetric incomplete mandible, and the output is a binary volumetric complete mandible.

# Requirements

Use `pip` to install the requirements as follows:
```
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Train
We use batch size of 2 by default and we show how to train models with 2 GPUs.

```
python Train.py --dataset_path */dataset  --save_path */save_model
```

# Validation
To evaluate our model, run:

```
python Inference.py --dataset_path */dataset  --save_path */save_model --output_path */output
```
# Mandible cutting algorithm

Our automatic pipeline consists of two main components:

Automated Cutting Pipeline ‚Äì used to segment the mandible from the input volume using a custom Mandible Cutting Algorithm module.

Reconstruction Pipeline ‚Äì utilizes a deep learning-based mandible reconstruction model to generate a complete mandible from the segmented input.

üí° Example usage for the Mandible Cutting Algorithm module is provided in this.

```
python process.py --template_mandible_path */template_mandible.nii.gz  --binary_volumetric_mandibles_path */mandible.nii.gz,
                  --binary_volumetric_healthy_defective_mandible_path */healthy&defective mandible.nii.gz, --output_path *output.nii.gz
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), we are unable to share the pretrained weights of our segmentation and reconstruction models, as well as the cutting template used in this study.
