# InceptMan

InceptMan is a deep learning model designed for mandible reconstruction, as proposed in our paper, "[InceptMan: An InceptionNeXt-Based Architecture for End-to-End Mandible Reconstruction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048542)" The input is a binary volumetric incomplete mandible, and the output is a binary volumetric complete mandible.
